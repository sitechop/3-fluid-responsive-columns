					<p>Capistrano is probably the coolest and best way you can deploy your rails applications today, but it can frustrating to set up and understand. A few months ago I showed you how to deploy from an Ubuntu machine, and today I’m going to show you how it’s done on a Windows 8.1 machine. This was a major pain to figure out, so hopefully this will make the process painless for the next.</p>

					<p>Before you begin, there’s a security issue I have to bring up. Capistrano on windows will not work using SSH to connect to your server. I searched far and wide and found no solution. To work around this problem we’re going to allow a deploy user with limited permissions to connect using password protection.</p>

					<p>This tutorial is to take you through the Capistrano deployment portion of pushing a Rails application to production. By this point you should have your production server ready to go. My set up is running Ruby, Ngnix, MySQL, and Phusion Passenger. You will also need Git installed. If you’re not there yet, I’ve written guides on setting up every portion, they’re listed below:</p>
